** summary

My workflow with gpt 3.5 is a lot of copy paste so this helps with
that.

My flow:
#+begin_example
Advise that any code gpt returns is in txtar format
I copy code to my clipboard
I run this app and it extracts the txtar archive from my clipboard to current dir.
#+end_example

I'm guessing copilot renders my flow pointless, but I haven't messed with copilot yet.

** gpt

We will create golang app that will make use of these packages:
#+begin_example
github.com/atotto/clipboard
golang.org/x/tools/txtar
#+end_example

#+begin_example
write the contents of the clipboard to a temp file
write the path of the tempfile to stderr so we can debug later
use the txtar package to detect if the temp file is in txtar compliant format
for each file in txtar archive, extract it
if there are no errors in extraction, then delete temp file

make sure to not use io/ioutil since its deprecated.
#+end_example

** usage

#+begin_example
# manually copy txtar file to clipboard
make 
./polarpaw --verbose --verbose
#+end_example

observe: files have been expanded from txtar archive to current directory as base directory.
